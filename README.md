Don't you wish JavaScript was more powerful? Have you ever launched the developer console in your browser, wanted to stick in a **quick** utility library to get **useful** data types or functionality to solve your **drive-by** code problems, but don't have a decent, handy option?

* Underscore.JS has a lot of functions, but they're for data trasversing, and not useful in solving problems aside from getting shorthands.
* jQuery can do a lot, but mostly with playing around DOM, and is practically devoid of assistance when you're solving a code problem.
* ...

Fear no more!
1. Load **Temples**: `(document.body || document.head || document.documentElement).insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', '<script src="https://rawgit.com/Unihedro/Temples/master/script.js"></script>')`
2. *???*
3. Profit!!!
